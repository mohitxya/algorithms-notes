#### Introduction
- Directed and Undirected graphs.
- Circular things: nodes or vertex. Represented by numbers.
- Line: Edge, un-directed edge, directed edge.
- Directed: Can go in one direction only.
**Cycles in a Graph:**
- Binary Tree is a graph.
- Doesn't have to be enclosed.
- cycle: start and end at same node.
- Acyclic: No cycles.
- Degree of node: number of edges attached to it.
- Total degree= sum of all degrees= 2 x edges
**Directed Graphs:**
- Indegree (edges coming in) and Outdegree(edges going out).
**Edge Weight:**
- weight associated with an edge.
- If not specified assume 1.
**Graph Representation:**
